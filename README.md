# RealView
A tool for visualizing real-time financial data from different sources.
## Learning outcomes
* Learn how to capture real-time data from the Binance API
* Learn how to display data using javascript libraries
* Build a functional website to be able to display more than three cryptocurrency live prices on different time scales set by the user.
* Change the display type (line charts vs candlestick charts)

## Node package manager (npm)
I am planning on using npm to manage my dependencies and packages for this project. 
Npm is an industry standard technology required to install different node packages. Node packages are written in the Node environment built on the V8 Javascript runtime environment created by google.

## Node Modules
The list of node modules I used in this project is shown below:
* Jqeury
    - For manipulating the DOM
* wscat
    - For connecting to websockets and streaming data from the binance API
* Lightweight charts
    - For displaying financial information in chart form
